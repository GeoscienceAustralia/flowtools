LASextractor
============

R package for reading lidar data from las files and extracting various subsets of interest.

For example it can be used to semi-interactively extract LIDAR point elevations along a road or levee.

This code is sporadically developed based on the needs of the developers and
colleagues. The open source release is mainly to assist with our own management
of the code, as well as to allow others to use it. Bugfixes/suggestions are
nonetheless welcome. 

Installation requires that you have the programs 'las2txt' and 'lasinfo' in
your search path. These are freely available at
http://www.cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/lastools/ 
You also need to have the unstructInterp package installed:
FIXME point to github page
FIXME: Insert information on installing directly from github.

If you'd like to contribute any routines or fix bugs, consider forking the
code, inserting your changes and sending the maintainer a pull request.
Otherwise bug reports / suggestions can be sent to the maintainer.
